        When two or more users share the same file, it is necessary to define the semantics of reading and writing precisely to avoid problems. 
        In single-processor systems that permit processes to share files, such as UNIX, 
        the semantics normally state that when a READ operation follows a WRITE operation, 
        the READ returns the value just written, as shown in Figure . Similarly, 
        when two writes happen in quick succession, followed by a READ, 
        the value read is the value stored by the last write. In effect, 
        the system enforces an absolute time ordering on all operations and always returns the most recent value. 
        We will refer to this model as UNIX semantics. This model is easy to understand and straightforward to implement.
