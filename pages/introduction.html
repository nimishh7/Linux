            Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. <br>
            In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. <br> 
            An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. <br>
            To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. <br>
            Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn't function.
