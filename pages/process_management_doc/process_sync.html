            Process synchronization , in Linux involves providing a <br>
            time slice for each process , <br>
            so that they get the required time for execution. <br><br>
            The process can be created using the fork() command in Linux. 
            The creating process is called the parent process and the created process is the child process.
             A child process can have only one parent but a parent process may have many children. 
             Both the parent and child processes have the same memory image,
            open files and environment strings. However, they have distinct address spaces
