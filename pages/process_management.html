            When you execute a program on your Unix system, the system creates a special environment for that program. <br>
            This environment contains everything needed for the system to run the program as if no other program were running on the system. <br>
            Whenever you issue a command in Unix, it creates, or starts, a new process. When you tried out the ls command to list the directory contents, <br>
             you started a process. A process, in simple terms, is an instance of a running program. <br>
            The operating system tracks processes through a five-digit ID number known as the pid or the process ID. <br> 
            Each process in the system has a unique pid. <br>
            Pids eventually repeat because all the possible numbers are used up and the next pid rolls or starts over. <br>
            At any point of time, no two processes with the same pid exist in the system because it is the pid that Unix uses to track each process. <br>
