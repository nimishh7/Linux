        Linux memory management subsystem is responsible, as the name implies, 
        for managing the memory in the system. 
        This includes implemnetation of virtual memory and demand paging, 
        memory allocation both for kernel internal structures and user space programms, 
        mapping of files into processes address space and many other things. <br><br>
        Linux memory management is a complex system with many configurable settings. 
        Most of these settings are available via /proc filesystem and can be quired and adjusted using sysctl.
        These APIs are described in Documentation/admin-guide/sysctl/vm.rst and in man 5 proc. <br><br><br>
        The memory management in Linux is a complex system that evolved over the years and included 
        more and more functionality to support a variety of systems from MMU-less microcontrollers to supercomputers. 
        he memory management for systems without an MMU is called nommu and it definitely deserves a dedicated document,
        which hopefully will be eventually written. 
        Yet, although some of the concepts are the same, here we assume that an MMU is available and a CPU 
        can translate a virtual address to a physical address.
